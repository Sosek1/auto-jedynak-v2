# Driving School's website written in React

# https://auto-jedynka.pl/

## Description

I created this website over year ago and now I've remade it so the admin(owner of driving school) can upload photos and messages to his students as well as website's visitors.  
The first version of this page was wirtten in HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and copy-pasted PHP and wasn't reactive at all (except contact form whitch as I said before was copy-pasted).  
My update provided kind of CMS for my client, written from scratch. This project shows my progress from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and React.  
I'm even more glad I managed to make this progress considering that I had High School final exams this year and started to learn React in June.
